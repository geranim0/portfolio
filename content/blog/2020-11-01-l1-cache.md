Using compile-time programming and TMP, I made a simple program to calculate the size of the L1 cache. 
The way it works, is that it will generate arrays of length of a power of 2, and do random operations on that array for a fixed amount of iterations.
The times for it to finish, for each length of the array, is calculated. To identify the size of your L1 cache, simply look at the output produced by the program. 
It will be insanely fast for all array lengths that still fit in your L1. As soon as your L1 fills up, your will see dramatically worse performances. 
You can identify L2 and L3 the same way, and eventually it will start not finding it in L3 and need to go to RAM.
