I am passionate about C++, parallelism and optimization. [Here's my CV](../SLM-CV-english.pdf)

# C++

I am proficient in C++ and enjoy TMP stuff, zero-cost abstractions, and writing code that's hard to use wrong. I am still learning as C++ is a complex language that's always growing, and I love it!


# Optimization

I recently fell in love with optimization and I'm currently learning a bunch about low-level optimizations and assembly to take full advantage of the underlying hardware.

# Parallelism

I have experience with PThreads, TBB, OpenMP, and OpenCL for GPUs. Currently learning a bunch about concurrent, lock-free data structures. And how / when to use relaxed atomics to gain maximum performance in multithreaded applications.

# Games

I have experience with both Unity3D and Unreal Engine 4.
