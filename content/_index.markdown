I like C++ and optimization. [Here's my CV](../SLM-CV-english.pdf)

# C++

I am proficient in C++ and enjoy TMP stuff, zero-cost abstractions, and writing code that's hard to use wrong. I never stop learning as C++ is a complex language that's always growing, and loving it.


# Optimization

I like optimization and learnin about low-level and assembly to take full advantage of the underlying hardware.


# Games

I have experience with both Unity3D and Unreal Engine 4.
