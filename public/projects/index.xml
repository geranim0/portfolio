      <description>Code can be found here
In university I had a course on video games, and I learned about a game engine pattern called ECS. This is my own toy implementation using archetypes. It is a work in progress, but the core of the metaprogramming is there.
ECS If you&amp;rsquo;re not already familiar with ECS, it means Entity Component System, and is a AoS (Array of Structs) optimisation, used for both performance and maintenability reasons.</description>

      <description>I made a Tetris bot that can play Tetris at more than 1 million blocks per second. To do that, I was inspired by someone who made something similar to this but it was running in javascript in the browser and it was really slow: took him about 2 weeks to clear 2 million lines, which is about 5 million blocks per 2 weeks. My bot, written in C++, is able to drop more than 1 million blocks per second.</description>
