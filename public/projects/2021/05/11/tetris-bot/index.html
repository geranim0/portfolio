<p><a href="https://github.com/geranim0/tetris_bot_v2">I made a Tetris bot</a> that can play Tetris at more than 1 million blocks per second. To do that, I was inspired by someone who <a href="https://codemyroad.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/tetris-ai-the-near-perfect-player/">made something similar to this</a> but it was running in javascript in the browser and it was really slow: took him about 2 weeks to clear 2 million lines, which is about 5 million blocks per 2 weeks. My bot, written in C++, is able to drop more than 1 million blocks per second.</p>
<p>First, I retook his approach of hand-crafting metrics to evaluate the value of a board, and then training the values using a Genetic Algorithm metaheuristic. For my version, I use 4 metrics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aggregate height. It&rsquo;s the sum of all heights of all columns in the board.</li>
<li>Lines destroyed by placing current block.</li>
<li>Holes. Number of holes in the current board.</li>
<li>Bumpiness. Sum of the absolute value of the differences between neighbor columns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the very simple to use Genetic Algorithm implementation found <a href="https://github.com/olmallet81/GALGO-2.0">here</a>, I then trained the weights for the 4 metrics, playing for 100,000 deaths and optimizing for total lines cleared in 100,000 deaths. It was really easy to setup thanks to its simple API. The only thing I had to modify is to be able to pass variadic arguments to its templates.</p>
<p>The weights are I obtained are {-7.41, 9.55, -9.366, -3.28 }.</p>
<h1 id="optimisation-techniques">Optimisation techniques</h1>
<p>After that, all is left to do is create the most optimized possible tetris player. I did this by heavy use of templates, template metaprogramming, and new C++ features such as variants and tuples. I made everything that can be computable at compile time constexpr. That way, at runtime, everything goes as fast as possible.</p>
<p>For example, the function that evaluates the board takes the board and a tetrimino, and evaluates all possible positions for that tetrimino, and returns the best board possible by placing that tetrimino. Since each tetrimino is known at compile-time (I made the tetriminos constexpr), each tetrimino is its own type. With this I was able to make the evaluation a template that specializes for each type of tetrimino, resulting in highly optimized evaluation function code for each tetrimino.</p>
<p>Another trick that I used to boost performance was careful engineering of the board representation. If we want to take advantage of bitwise operators, we have 2 options: using ints as colums or rows. In an earlier implementation (and much slower) I used ints as rows. It works okay for certain types of metrics, but the real problem with this is the line destruction. When we clear a line, it can be at any height. How to do this? If we use a vector, removing elements in the middle is O(n). Bad. Linked list? Indirection is too costly. I found the solution to this with the help of the IRC C community.</p>
<p>At this point I already knew the limitations of ints as rows, so I was trying the ints as columns technique, but I could not figure out how to destroy a line efficiently. What we need is a way to, given a mask of full lines (which is easy to do in a single pass of the columns using bitwise operators), destroy every bit of every column where the (mask &amp; 1) is true. Turns out, there is an instrinsic called &ldquo;_pext&rdquo; that does exactly that! Thanks IRC.</p>
<p>All the other metrics use carefully chosen intrinsics. I use &ldquo;__builtin_clzll&rdquo; which returns the position of the first bit set to true, and &ldquo;__builtin_popcount&rdquo; which returns the number of bits set to true. Both of these builtin functions are why this Tetris bot is going fast.</p>
<h1 id="fun-with-template-metaprogramming-and-constexpr">Fun with template metaprogramming and constexpr</h1>
<p>As a side note, when the bot was already going full speed, I had an itch about some copy pasta code in my iomplementation. 
At each iteration, we choose a random tetrimino, and call the evaluation function on the current board and that tetrimino. To do that I had a big switch with the same code in each case, the only thing that changed is the tetrimino I passed. But since each tetrimino is its own unique type, how to do this without using a switch? 
I was able to make the switch go away for a single function call using template metaprogramming. The way it works, is that I first generate a constexpr array of functors that take an std::variant of all tetriminos, and inside each functor the variant is compile-time resolved to its true type. After getting this array of functors, all we need to do is make a function that taken an index for the type of tetrimino, return the corresponding function in the array of functors, and call it with the correct parameters. Using this technique, I was able to delete my switch and my code duplication for a nice and simple 1-call function, and at 0 cost! I verified performance before and after, it is the same. The code generated is almost identical: with the switch the code generated was a jump table, and it is the exact same with the cleaner new implementation. We do a single jump in the array, and do the call. You can see my implementation of the compile-time functor array in the file &ldquo;constexpr_func_arr.hpp&rdquo;.</p>
